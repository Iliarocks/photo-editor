This is a simple photo editor that allows users to import and make basic adjuments to an image like exposure, contrast, tint, and temperature.

If you like to try it out you can download a .jar file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17a-9QB2AxUC6c9pKy-SY5HF5dj3EzaqI/view?usp=drive_link). Once downloaded, double-click on the file to run.
